# QALD+ Dataset Description

QALD+ is the dataset for Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) based on well-known [QALD-9](https://github.com/ag-sc/QALD/tree/master/9/data).

QALD+ enables to train and test KGQA systems over DBpedia and Wikidata using questions in 8 different languages.

Some of the questions have several alternative writings in particular languages which enables to evaluate the robustness of KGQA systems and train paraphrasing models.

As the questions' translations were provided by native speakers, they are considered as "gold standard", therefore, machine translation tools can be trained and evaluated on the dataset.
